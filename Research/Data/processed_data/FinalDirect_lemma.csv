1504,  be ds still a relevant field of study ? this be debate pretty heavily I think its a relevant study if the goal be to produce data literate people that hopefully embed cs and stat to any domain I think the issue be that they focus on ml ai deployment strategy without have the prerequisite domain knowledge to consider if they need any intensive ml solution vs simple stat like linear regression another thing I notice be every job listing have its own definition of ds lol one post describe pure de work but list it as a ds position yeah infamously facebook data science position be mostly sql monkey stuff other than fang and tech org alot of company have very weak data practice so if you be to be a ds you need to be a de to engineer the pipeline for your own solution in summary I want to ask whether pursue a strict ds degree affect my employment chance with the late diminish role see for data scientist ? if you be a work professional I don t think you should think about your chance of employment when you re obtain a high degree you can still get a job with a undergrad like you have just demonstrate the purpose of get a master be to elevate and broaden your horizon within data stat cs that s something you enjoy learn the aftermath be look for oppurtunie to use that experience ds will be package around other title like analytic engineer mle but also if your career goal be not to be too technical why go for a master ? unless you enjoy learn go for it ,DIRECT

6140,hm so a feature be it marketplace or anything else be successful to the extent that it make the company facebook money so from there you ask okay how be facebook make money ? let s suppose the answer to this question be idk ad from there u can ask okay what make advertiser want to advertise on facebook ? perhaps the answer to this question be advertiser will advertise when a lot of people will see their ad and or people will see their ad many time okay so market place be a successful feature to the extent that it make people log onto facebook and make they stay on it for long from there u want to determine well do marketplace actually make more people log on and do it actually make people stay on for long ? so the metric you might want to look at to answer that question could be the number of people who be log on and head straight for the marketplace and how much time user be actually spend on market place page and see how these metric be vary over time what I realize while try to answer this be advertiser probably also care about the number of people actually click on their ad not just how many people see they and how many time people see they so an additional metric to look at would be the ctr for ad on marketplace page maybe not strictly necessary but it might also be insightful to look at all these metric for the marketplace and compare marketplace s performance on they to the performance of other feature I say it s not strictly necessary because marketplace can be do a bad job at add traffic relative to the other feature but still up the net traffic to the site but the comparison might be insightful in the sense that if hypothetically marketplace be way bad at generate traffic then it might make more sense to allocate resource to other feature or even new feature that be hopefully close to average level of traffic generation ,DIRECT

5518,but this do not happen with microsoft luis use the same training data generate different score for the same utterance why this happen ? when have neural network one of the doubt be how to initialize the weight before start the training in nlp js the same training data generate exactly the same answer because the initialization of the weight be always to put all the weight to 0 so there be no random data in the initialization neither during the training but one of the technique to initialize the weight be to use random noise and that mean that two different training will not start with exactly the same numeric situation so we can thing that this be what be happen in microsoft luis they be initialize the network with some noise ,DIRECT

542,usually this decision would be partly guide by domain knowledge and party empirically I e what give you well result in term of domain knowledge think about how the image you will run inference on might differ from your data or think about what sort of thing in the data you want your model to be invariant to for instance be the bank note always capture at the same angle ? if not a random rotation might be good to make the model more rotation invariant be all banknote scale the same ? if not you can add random scaling do color information matter or not ? if not you can add color jittering will the banknote be upside down or vertically ? then you can add random flip you can add blurring or noise if you expect your note to be out of focus or capture with different camera change gamma contrast brightness to be invariant to lighting condition and so on you can take a look at the albumentation package for an implementation of pretty much all of commonly use image augmentation for the empirical part you ll just have to see what work for instance I find that random flip often help even in case where logically it doesn t make sense but I guess it s a form of regularization so the model still produce well result ,DIRECT
