4108,hello everyone something intriguing occurred while i am researching on rare disease event with an hospital as we are dealing with rare events it might be obvious we are dealing with severe class imbalance problem that we are dealing by combining 1 a random undersampling technique and 2 an adaboost method with a basic random forest as the base learner i e a rusboost configuration in addition we ran this configuration using a deep forest configuration that employs layers of nn but with a base learning classifier in place of neurons although that is probably irrelevant here overall the outcomes were far superior to a baseline model from a medical standpoint therefore we decided to proceed but still as we are dealing with rare events class imbalance our results are a little weak but that is ok medically speaking for the time being we are now in the phase of plotting a bit of our results and something truly fascinating has occurred i believe our model has poor calibration since he consistently predicts a value slightly above for one class and slightly below for the other not and for exemple given a binary class prediction according to the probabilities i received it does not appear that there is a significant difference between the two classes from the algorithm standpoint presumably a calibration issue may i inquire what are your thoughts please guys? maybe the ru or deep forest or adaboost the potential issue? in addition i have included two brief screenshots one shows the proba that are like that almost for the whole dataset the second shows the distribution of my two class given their proba and it appears is for one class and for the other mostly i would have anticipated for a given record one proba class with and the other with or less than close to for sure cheers everyone for your help ,DIRECT

3410, dear tscosj asking a clear and concise question is an important step in getting a helpful and accurate answer providing full context and a minimal working example can greatly improve the chances of getting a useful response when asking a question it is important to give enough information so that someone reading it has a clear understanding of the problem you are facing this includes providing details about the context in which the problem is occurring as well as any relevant information about the software or system you are using a minimal working example is a small piece of code or configuration that demonstrates the problem you are facing it should be as short as possible while still showing the issue you are experiencing by providing a minimal working example you make it easier for others to understand and reproduce the problem which can help them find a solution more quickly here are a few points to consider when asking a question to ensure that you provide enough context and a minimal working example clearly describe the problem you are facing what are you trying to accomplish? what happened instead? provide details about the context in which the problem is occurring what software or system are you using? what version? what are the relevant settings or configurations? include any error messages or other output that you have encountered these can provide valuable clues about the cause of the problem provide a minimal working example this should be a small piece of code or configuration that demonstrates the problem you are experiencing be sure to include any necessary setup or dependencies by following these guidelines you can help others understand your question and find a solution more quickly and effectively sincerely your name ,DIRECT

4951,sure sounds good but think maybe my context wasn t enough basically they themselves don t have a clear question in mind and so i am planning on helping them identify kpi s and other metrics and will get stuck into there data to find things that hopefully ultimately help them optimise and improve on these kpi s during this process i will need a good way of not only documenting my data and the story say through something like jupyter notebooks but be able to then share the end results whether in the end the analysis leads to me creating an dashboard graphs through a bi tool such as powerbi which can then be shared easily for there consumption or creating say a standalone document such as pdf in both scenarios is there a best practice way to upload the separate analysis pieces such that they can have easy intuitive access and consumption of the information? say i use pdfs which contain the business question analysis etc is there a location where people tend to put this so that it is accessible by business executives etc who want to read it? product manager said shouldn t really have executives having to go through github pages etc searching for it so was wondering whether anyone has suggestions or best practices they use or know of? for interactive dashboards visuals they want to view in order to keep track of kpi s etc i feel is fine to be created shared over bi tools like powerbi however then for analysis that s done in python not 100 sure whether its worth having those graphs data displayed into powerbi or if this is common practice or frowned upon etc? apologies though think context at this point is still fairly limited so kind of hard to fully describe put across situation but this is sort of along the lines of my current thought process ,DIRECT

1504, is ds still a relevant field of study? this is debated pretty heavily i think its a relevant study if the goal is to produce data literate people that hopefully embeds cs and stats to any domain i think the issue is that they focus on ml ai deployment strategies without having the prerequisite domain knowledge to consider if they need any intensive ml solution vs simple stats like linear regression another thing i noticed was every job listing has its own definition of ds lol one post describes pure de work but lists it as a ds position yeah infamously facebook data science position is mostly sql monkey stuff other than fang and tech orgs alot of companies have very weak data practices so if you were to be a ds you need to be a de to engineer the pipelines for your own solutions in summary i wanted to ask whether pursuing a strict ds degree affect my employment chances with the latest diminishing roles seen for data scientists? if you are a working professional i don t think you should think about your chances of employment when you re obtaining a higher degree you can still get a job with a undergrad like you have just demonstrated the purpose of getting a masters is to elevate and broaden your horizons within data stats cs thats something you enjoy learning the aftermath is looking for oppurtunies to use that experience ds will be packaged around other titles like analytics engineer mle but also if your career goal is not to be too technical why go for a masters? unless you enjoy learning go for it,DIRECT

5656,that sounds like a very interesting topic the first thing that comes to my mind would be to have a cnn classifier to classify wether the glasses match or not to gather data it would be best to have data from a big online glasses vendor with live tryout functionality that way you might can collect images from people trying out glasses and you might also have the final decision of them which they bought your target could then simply be has he bought it or not or maybe how much time did the customer spend on looking at that glasses before actually buying ugly glasses might just be looked at for a few seconds while the good ones are opened in a different tab to cross reference with other models but this would be some ideal data that i could think of right know can you elaborate your existing dataset a little more?,DIRECT

6140,hm so a feature be it marketplace or anything else is successful to the extent that it makes the company facebook money so from there you ask okay how is facebook making money? let s suppose the answer to this question is idk ads from there u can ask okay what makes advertisers want to advertise on facebook? perhaps the answer to this question is advertisers will advertise when a lot of people will see their ads and or people will see their ads many times okay so market place is a successful feature to the extent that it makes people log onto facebook and makes them stay on it for longer from there u want to determine well does marketplace actually make more people log on and does it actually make people stay on for longer? so the metrics you might want to look at to answer that question could be the number of people who are logging on and heading straight for the marketplace and how much time users are actually spending on market place pages and see how these metrics are varying over time what i realized while trying to answer this was advertisers probably also care about the number of people actually clicking on their ads not just how many people see them and how many times people see them so an additional metric to look at would be the ctr for ads on marketplace pages maybe not strictly necessary but it might also be insightful to look at all these metrics for the marketplace and compare marketplace s performance on them to the performance of other features i say it s not strictly necessary because marketplace can be doing a worse job at adding traffic relative to the other features but still upping the net traffic to the site but the comparison might be insightful in the sense that if hypothetically marketplace is way worse at generating traffic then it might make more sense to allocate resources to other features or even new features that are hopefully closer to average levels of traffic generation,DIRECT

5518,but this does not happen with microsoft luis using the same training data generates different scores for the same utterance why this happen? when having neural networks one of the doubts is how to initialize the weights before starting the training in nlp js the same training data generates exactly the same answers because the initialization of the weights is always to put all the weights to 0 so there is no random data in the initialization neither during the training but one of the techniques to initialize the weights is to use random noise and that means that two different trainings will not start with exactly the same numeric situation so we can thing that this is what is happening in microsoft luis they are initializing the network with some noise ,DIRECT

5739, thank you very much i appreciate that are any of these topics you yourself find interesting?,DIRECT
542,usually this decision would be partly guided by domain knowledge and party empirically i e what gives you better results in terms of domain knowledge think about how the images you will run inference on might differ from your data or think about what sort of things in the data you want your model to be invariant to for instance are the bank notes always captured at the same angle? if not a random rotation might be good to make the model more rotation invariant are all banknotes scaled the same? if not you can add random scaling does color information matter or not? if not you can add color jittering will the banknotes be upside down or vertically? then you can add random flips you can add blurring or noise if you expect your notes to be out of focus or captured with different cameras change gamma contrast brightness to be invariant to lighting conditions and so on you can take a look at the albumentations package for an implementation of pretty much all of commonly used image augmentations for the empirical part you ll just have to see what works for instance i find that random flips often help even in cases where logically it doesn t make sense but i guess it s a form of regularization so the model still produces better results ,DIRECT
