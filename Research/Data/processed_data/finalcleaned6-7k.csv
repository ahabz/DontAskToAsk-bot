1164940109225922641,friends a question how could i obtain a variable reading regularity from two variables reading frequency and number of books read in the last 12 months the reading frequency has the following categories daily 2 several times a week 3 once a week 4 once a month 5 once every three months 6 at least once a year i only have these two variables to form the variable regularity i thought of assigning a number to each category of my variable reading frequency for example to daily i gave 7 to several times a week i gave a 5 to at least once a year i gave 1 then i thought of multiplying these values with the values of the variable number of books for example if someone reads once a week 4 and has read 12 books in the last 12 months their reading regularity score would be 4 x if someone else reads daily 7 but has only read 5 books in the last 12 months their score would be 7 x from this resulting variable i thought about grouping the scores into regular not regular or very regular regular not regular any suggestions please? is there any technique or methodology for this? thanks,3,208,friend a question how could I obtain a variable read regularity from two variable read frequency and number of book read in the last 12 month the reading frequency have the follow category daily 2 several time a week 3 once a week 4 once a month 5 once every three month 6 at least once a year I only have these two variable to form the variable regularity I think of assign a number to each category of my variable reading frequency for example to daily I give 7 to several time a week I give a 5 to at least once a year I give 1 then I think of multiply these value with the value of the variable number of book for example if someone read once a week 4 and have read 12 book in the last 12 month their reading regularity score would be 4 x if someone else read daily 7 but have only read 5 book in the last 12 month their score would be 7 x from this result variable I think about group the score into regular not regular or very regular regular not regular any suggestion please ? be there any technique or methodology for this ? thank

I e when you get an invoice from a vendor how do you make sure it get store in data lake w e store ? this will have to be some storing module that handle probably two thing if your vendor have webhook it can receive datum from they or maybe if they send email your service will automatically handle it and normalize store the datum problem 2 when do you run what ? you ll want a service that run at some interval create invoice as need and make sure there be no dup send etc this will be some sort of send module it will periodically query the data store and generate the invoice need it will have to have some kind of do table to make sure you don t double send

697996475048656916,hey guys quick question hopefully here s the context i have a dataset of 20 different features approx some ordinal some binary some nominal etc 4 of those features are binary columns that indicate whether a user has used a specific function of my app i d like to make a predictive model where i can enter a new user and get as a result what function that user is likely to use the reason i m beating my head here is because i want to start out simple the way i see it is using specific functions of the app aren t exclusive scenarios meaning just because a user used function 1 doesn t mean he doesn t use function 2 i would need a predictor that tells me what probability of using each function he has independently so in a way i m obtaining 4 probability values for each user each probability value corresponding to a specific function of the app so my questions 1 what algo do i go to for the type of prediction i m looking for? 2 i can t really get my head around how if i choose only 4 variables k means would show me how the universe distributes around the 4 specific functions i m asking for instead of any of the other variables 3 anyone think of a way i can simplify the model some more? thanks for reading this far,4,243,hey guy quick question hopefully here s the context I have a dataset of 20 different feature approx some ordinal some binary some nominal etc 4 of those feature be binary column that indicate whether a user have use a specific function of my app i d like to make a predictive model where I can enter a new user and get as a result what function that user be likely to use the reason I m beat my head here be because I want to start out simple the way I see it be use specific function of the app aren t exclusive scenario mean just because a user use function 1 doesn t mean he doesn t use function 2 I would need a predictor that tell I what probability of use each function he have independently so in a way I m obtain 4 probability value for each user each probability value correspond to a specific function of the app so my question 1 what algo do I go to for the type of prediction I m look for ? 2 I can t really get my head around how if I choose only 4 variable k mean would show I how the universe distribute around the 4 specific function I m ask for instead of any of the other variable 3 anyone think of a way I can simplify the model some more ? thank for read this far
