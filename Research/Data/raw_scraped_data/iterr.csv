1226066823519408219,"Hallo, long time, I ask no doubt <:pleaserespond:916318693980520548> 

I am trying to build a personal project around 50,000 urls to fetch some info some as names, addresses, contact information from it etc.

At the start, I had some similar structuring so I got some data using parsing libraries and regex...

But now all page structures are different.

I thought of just passing down visible text to legendary gpt4 api or even batch wise to gpt 3.5 and ask it to parse it but as per my calculations, it will become costly at what scale I am trying to do it (can't compromise with scale, have already done)

Another issue is that it also returns bad data sometimes 


Is there a better, free or even cheaper approach for a college student to parse such useful information using AI or ML?"

1222275937048203305,"Hi everyone. I have the following project at work and here is the approach i'm taking. I wanted to get high level suggestions if possible on this approach thanks very much!

Context
- I have data for users and the content they've engaged with. For now, the content comes from 1 platform where users can view content but it could come from multiple platforms in the future. 
- Each content is tagged with certain categories. I also have categories that our users are interested in. 
- Note that the interaction data (users viewing content) is very sparse 

My goal is to create a v1 recommendation system where we recommend content to users as follows:
- Create a collaborative filtering model using the sparse interaction data. Optimize is using the map@k metric. The data will be implicit (binary as viewed or not)
- Create a content based model using the attached metadata (categories of the content and interest categories of users). I will use Jaccard similarity for this
- Use some sort hybrid logic to combine recommendations and deliver to users as ""we recommend these 10 something content to you"". This content will obviouslty not have been viewed by users

Evaluation
- I will evaluate the impact of this rec system by measuring change in engagement metrics overall as well as other indirect business metrics
 
Any suggestions here as to improving this flow?"

I hope you're all doing well! I've been thinking a lot about my academic path lately, particularly in relation to data science. It's a field that really intrigues me, but I have to admit, I struggle quite a bit with math. I feel like I've missed out on some fundamental topics like permutation and combination, as well as statistics, mainly because of a lack of guidance from my teachers. Balancing schoolwork with other commitments like going to the gym has been quite challenging, and I often find myself falling behind in the syllabus.

I'm considering pursuing data science in college, but I have some concerns about whether I'll be able to manage the workload while still maintaining a social life.

By random noise I mean ""fake"" / hallucinated clusters that are shown but don't actually exist in the original data set

The reason I ask is because it seems there is no actual useful information presented that I can use in my model. The clusters may or may not be real and there is no way of knowing even by changing hyperparameters. The cluster distances and density don't hold any value. 

Every article states all these caveats but doesn't show any actual information to use in the models, then says at the end ""it's a powerful tool in data science""??

1206533176437243925,"Usually this decision would be partly guided by domain knowledge and party empirically (i.e. what gives you better results).

In terms of domain knowledge, think about how the images you will run inference on might differ from your data. Or think about what sort of things in the data you want your model to be invariant to.

For instance, are the bank notes always captured at the same angle? If not, a random rotation might be good to make the model more rotation-invariant. Are all banknotes scaled the same? If not, you can add random scaling. Does color information matter or not? If not, you can add color jittering. Will the banknotes be upside down or vertically? Then you can add random flips. You can add blurring or noise if you expect your notes to be out of focus or captured with different cameras. Change gamma/contrast/brightness to be invariant to lighting conditions, and so on.

You can take a look at the Albumentations package for an implementation of pretty much all of commonly used image augmentations.

For the empirical part, you'll just have to see what works. For instance, I find that random flips often help even in cases where logically it doesn't make sense, but I guess it's a form of regularization so the model still produces better results."

Depends. You can do other transformation like scaling and log. But if your data is skewed already. How good can it be? What is your objective? To get a better accuracy score? Or do a hypothesis test? Why not try both side by side to determine the difference?

SO has Remarkable 2 since 2022. It has several QOL features (e.g. magnetic clip, left-hand access, longer battery). For performance, it has slightly less input lag (noticeable with any digitizer, but both enjoy the handwriting experience/resistance).

In terms of notes, I use mediums as:
- pen and notebook, 10s of years;
- pencil and notebook (Remarkable), 1~5 years;
- office paper, days~months;
- napkin, duration of lunch;

I know methods like OHE leave it already ""normalised"", but what about **BaseN** (or label enc.)? If my base is, say, 16, that will still cause that variable to weight more in distance calculation and so on due to the magnitude of the values, right?.. 
However due to how BaseN works, I'm not sure if it makes sense for  it to be normalised (atm I don't find a reason why it can't be).

We have a certain data field that in theory is very valuable to have filled out on the front end for a specific problem, but in reality it is often not filled out (only about 3% of the time). 

Can I use a logistic regression model to show how “important” it is to have this data field filled out when trying to predict the outcome of our business problem?

I want to use the coefficient interpretation to say “When this data field is filled out, there is a 25% greater chance that **dependent variable outcome** occurs. Thus, we should fill it out.”

I am a final year computer science student. I have been interested in ML and Data Science for past few months. Am decent/good with stats and linear algebra. 
Also complete andrew ng's ML course.
Haven't built any good projects though. 

I am not from a great college. So right out of my bachelor's its incredibly difficult to get any good DS roles that is `if there even are any entry level roles for DS/ML/data engineering`
I was wondering what path should I follow to get into MLE. I am interested in software design as well.  So I found data engineering can be good perhaps.
I dont really see myself getting into core research (as of now- who knows about the future?)

I have been doing full stack dev for the past month (its coz of a uni project).
So what I am wondering is will getting some full stack experience help me in any way to get into data related fields or not apart from any personal projects I make. Basically should i do general software engineering and improve my coding skills first
Or should I just stick to ML and jupyter note book based projects. What else should i do **practically** to get into data engineering roles atleast.
What I have been seeing is not many people are working or ML models from scratch but rather building upon existing licensed models like chatgpt.

Any advice?"

1173067109127950386,"hi guys, hopefully I can ask here a small statistic question that's confusing me in my analysis 🙂 
does anyone know how can I calculate consistency of values in Excel by also taking into account those values?

For example, there are 3 students and their scores on multiple exams, where score ranges from 0-100.

1st student scores are 99 79 85 100 88
2nd student scores are 55 56 58 52 53
3rd student scores are 20 98 57 34 92 

so obviously first student is the best and most ""consistent in a positive way"", but 2nd student is most consistent (lowest standard deviation) with his scores, but obviously not good as first one. The third one has the highest standard deviation (least consistent) but has higher average score on all tests than 2nd student. 

So is there a way to somehow put this all into measure/score and quantify it? Thanks!"

I am in the process of working on a project that requires some data science and thought this would be a good place to learn that/get help. Recently I have been trying to figure out a problem where I have to estimate signal noise (approximated by a high-pass filter) by finding an appropriate inverse transfer function based on a given square pulse that has been sent through a specific high-pass filter. So in short, I would need to find a way to get from the second diagram in the picture to the first, while determining the appropriate transfer function.

but what if i don't need that? i know how to write ETL's, so i can just take what i want, dump it in the same db, do my thing. and soon there will be random bits of data all over.

1164940109225922641,"Friends, a question, how could I obtain a variable ""reading regularity"" from two variables: reading frequency and number of books read in the last 12 months. The reading frequency has the following categories:

Daily 2. Several times a week 3. Once a week 4. Once a month 5. Once every three months 6. At least once a year

I only have these two variables to form the variable ""Regularity"". I thought of assigning a number to each category of my variable ""reading frequency"", for example to ""Daily"" I gave (7), to ""several times a week"" I gave a (5), ..., to ""at least once a year"" I gave (1). Then, I thought of multiplying these values with the values of the variable ""number of books"". For example, if someone reads ""Once a week"" (4) and has read 12 books in the last 12 months, their reading regularity score would be 4 x 12 = 48. If someone else reads ""Daily"" (7) but has only read 5 books in the last 12 months, their score would be 7 x 5 = 35. From this resulting variable, I thought about grouping the scores into Regular/not regular or Very regular/regular/not regular. Any suggestions, please? Is there any technique or methodology for this? Thanks"
1164932076810809464,thanks! do you have some general advice about workflows or best practices? or should i provide a specific example?
1164916911793000559,"Hi all. I have a carreer question, but i'll provide some background first. I have a degree in the biomedical field and have always worked in hospitals (+/-15 years). I've worked at the IT department in application management focussing on the different healthcare systems and their integration. For example, getting lab results tho the patient record. Over the years, I have tought myself basic python, linux, and SQL

During COVID i did almost all of the data extractions for reporting and eventually switched to the BI department of the hospital, which is NOT part of IT. I am now, what most people would discribe as an SQL monkey. 

A year ago, my only peer at the IT department left. A guy who kinda did what i do, but more robust, as his extractions and programming guide individual patient care, and mine guide policy. I don't care if miss 14 edge cases of high blood pressure in a year report that includes thousands of patient. As he was (is) more experienced than I, he was my mentor. He tought me a lot about ETL's and i know when i have to use those techniques. But when I'm not using our ETL framework, i feel like i have no clue what i'm doing. Of course, my jupyter notebooks are somewhat organised, i don't mix raw and processed data, i don't name my variables a and b.

I have a great boss. she tells me what to do, and i'm free to do whatever i want. But there's not really anyone in my organisation that can tell me (or suggest) how i should probably best do what i have to do. If i simplify it, i can make a .csv data dump and use python, or i can build daily scheduled incremental ETL's and have others build Power BI on top of that. What's in between and when to apply it?

Am I missing some resources? If i google this i find stuff like 'how to organise your code' or 'how to become a better programmer' kinda stuff. I don't think it's data governance, because a lot of what i do is temporarily and data governance looks more something for IT. I could be wrong ofcourse."

Pick any cloud provider you like, they all have free trials, and put together a simple project on there that shows the domain you're interested in without taking examples from others.

1155342510361690182,"> Is DS still a relevant field of study?

This is debated pretty heavily. I think its a relevant study if the goal is to produce data literate people that hopefully embeds CS and stats to any domain. I think the issue is that they focus on ML/AI/ Deployment strategies without having the prerequisite domain knowledge to consider if they need any intensive ML solution vs simple stats like linear regression. 

> Another thing I noticed was every job listing has its own definition of DS lol, one post describes pure DE work, but lists it as a DS position,

Yeah infamously Facebook data science position is mostly SQL monkey stuff. Other than FANG and tech orgs; alot of companies have very weak data practices - so if you were to be a DS, you need to be a DE to engineer the pipelines for your own solutions

>  In summary I wanted to ask whether pursuing a strict DS degree, affect my employment chances with the latest diminishing roles seen for data scientists?

If you are a working professional, I don't think you should think about your chances of employment when you're obtaining a higher degree. You can still get a job with a undergrad like you have just demonstrated.   

The purpose of getting a masters is to elevate and broaden your horizons within data/stats/cs. Thats something you enjoy learning. The aftermath is looking for oppurtunies to use that experience. DS will be packaged around other titles like analytics/engineer/MLE. 

But also if your career goal is not to be too technical - why go for a masters? Unless you enjoy learning. Go for it"
1155334293879521290,"Hey, new here, so pardon me if I am asking a very repetitive question. Is DS still a relevant field of study? I will be starting my Master's study in it soon, and I have carefully picked out a course which includes not only just ML related courses, but an array of software engineering and databases courses as well. I also understand that the degree  program you attend hardly ever translates to an exact copy of the career, which is fine with me. Another thing I noticed was every job listing has its own definition of DS lol, one post describes pure DE work, but lists it as a DS position, etc. In terms of personal interests, honestly, I am quite flexible. I studed EECS during my bachelors (Electrcial Eng and CS), and had a range of CS topics, from pure algorithmic to ML based ones. + been working since Aug 2021, and full time since April 2023, and since it's an AI startup, dipped my toes in everything, so have experience with experimenting, visualizing, pipelining, implementing and deploying entire sw structures, which is a bit hectic but I am glad since it should be a big help I imagine in the future. Not to mention, I never intended to stay in the technical role for too long, I envision myself eventually climbing to some managerial position, with context to data.

1146399710492500080,"Oh cool, this is nothing to do with tech then, it's bad headspace.

Just apply the STOP principle
Stop coding 

Take a step back - physically from the computer

Observe how you're feeling, without getting caught up in it. ""I feel like I'm not good at this"" without proceeding to ""so I shouldn't be a coder""/""I'll never be good at this"".

Proceed mindfully - how can you be most effective right now at getting better at coding? Is it asking someone else to help explain that concept? Is it re-reading it later?  Taking a walk? I've sometimes written down the problem and solution in a notebook and gone out to get coffee. It's easier to think about the issue when I've got no tech near me.

Ultimately it's not effective to stew on the feeling of whether you're good or bad at this. What's effective is finding a path forward."

   - Like flowers (Iris) or something.
   - Wine? Yeah, they've got wine data.
   - Some census thing about making $50K.

2. **Kaggle**: It's a site. They've got competitions and data.
   - Titanic? People trying to guess who lived.
   - House prices. Yawn.
   - Tweets about disasters. Some are fake.

3. **Government Stuff**: Some governments dump their data online.
   - US has one. UK too. India? Yep.

4. **World Bank**: They've got numbers on... world stuff.

5. **Gapminder**: More global numbers. Income, life, blah blah.

6. **FiveThirtyEight**: They do news and stats. Check their site.

7. **NLP?**:
   - Movie reviews on IMDb. Like thumbs up or down.
   - 20 Newsgroups. It's old but people use it.

8. **Pictures**:
   - CIFAR-10. Tiny pics of stuff.
   - MNIST. Doodles of numbers.

9. **Time Series**:
   - Airplanes and passengers from the 50s.
   - Stocks. Yahoo has them, I guess.

10. **Social Networks**:
   - Stanford's got a collection. It's big.

Tasks or whatever:
- Clean the messy data.
- Look at it, find patterns.
- Make some charts.
- Maybe build a model if you're feeling fancy.

There. Hope that helps or whatever."

Next interesting thing white balance:
There is no real perfect white balance method. You could use a grey card, that would be the most reliable, but therefore everyone owning the app would need a grey card, which has right from production the same color as the one the camera of the training got calibrated on.

Next thing brightness:
In every spot in the world is a little bit different brightness, sure you wouldnt need to be that specific, but you would need a spot where your skin gots the perfect light

Is a mean square error of 0.35 good? 

If you are forecasting temperatures in Celsius, 0.35°C of error is pretty good, assuming also that your application doesn't require a lower error. For example if you are running an experiment where temperature variations of 0.1 C° will ruin the lab samples, suddenly an error of 0.35°C is bad.

Is an accuracy of 90% good? If you are predicting whether stock will go up or down tomorrow it's pretty good. If you are predicting if Nicolas Cage's next movie will be over the top, it's terrible because 9 out of 10 of his movies are over the top, so it's no better than a random guess.

I completed self studying calculus 1 and 2. My plan is to do calc 3 w/ probability, and linear algebra w/ statistics after that.

However, MITOCW's probabilistic systems and applied probability has been rather difficult for me. One of my good friends recommended Georgie Tech's proabibility course. 

So my question is are the following two courses enough to get me started with Data Science?

1. Geogria's Probability https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sman/courses/6739/
also available on edx: https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-probability-random-variables
2. Statistics for applications: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/

OR https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/pages/resource-index/ is a must? I am currently taking this right now and I am not a huge fan of the psets. Its way too hard and so are the recitations and since there aren't any easy problems the learning curve is way too steep. I am also in a time crunch so its hard for me to go out of my way to research new things.

Georgia's probability also has stats in the course. But its preferable I take statistics for applications as well right?"

1206533176437243925,"Usually this decision would be partly guided by domain knowledge and party empirically (i.e. what gives you better results).

In terms of domain knowledge, think about how the images you will run inference on might differ from your data. Or think about what sort of things in the data you want your model to be invariant to.

For instance, are the bank notes always captured at the same angle? If not, a random rotation might be good to make the model more rotation-invariant. Are all banknotes scaled the same? If not, you can add random scaling. Does color information matter or not? If not, you can add color jittering. Will the banknotes be upside down or vertically? Then you can add random flips. You can add blurring or noise if you expect your notes to be out of focus or captured with different cameras. Change gamma/contrast/brightness to be invariant to lighting conditions, and so on.

You can take a look at the Albumentations package for an implementation of pretty much all of commonly used image augmentations.

For the empirical part, you'll just have to see what works. For instance, I find that random flips often help even in cases where logically it doesn't make sense, but I guess it's a form of regularization so the model still produces better results."

Depends. You can do other transformation like scaling and log. But if your data is skewed already. How good can it be? What is your objective? To get a better accuracy score? Or do a hypothesis test? Why not try both side by side to determine the difference? 

I personally have seen log transformation do very well for clustering. For linear models - could very well do the same. but it depends on what your y^ is."

SO has Remarkable 2 since 2022. It has several QOL features (e.g. magnetic clip, left-hand access, longer battery). For performance, it has slightly less input lag (noticeable with any digitizer, but both enjoy the handwriting experience/resistance).

In terms of notes, I use mediums as:
- pen and notebook, 10s of years;
- pencil and notebook (Remarkable), 1~5 years;
- office paper, days~months;
- napkin, duration of lunch;

The main criticism I have is that the notes aren't as appealing in digital form (on a monitor, it looks like regular tablet handwriting--or perhaps my handwriting is poor)"

I know methods like OHE leave it already ""normalised"", but what about **BaseN** (or label enc.)? If my base is, say, 16, that will still cause that variable to weight more in distance calculation and so on due to the magnitude of the values, right?.. 
However due to how BaseN works, I'm not sure if it makes sense for  it to be normalised (atm I don't find a reason why it can't be).
 
Would you say normalizing encoded categories depends on the method used for encoding? And if so, would you use it with BaseN?"

We have a certain data field that in theory is very valuable to have filled out on the front end for a specific problem, but in reality it is often not filled out (only about 3% of the time). 

Can I use a logistic regression model to show how “important” it is to have this data field filled out when trying to predict the outcome of our business problem?

I want to use the coefficient interpretation to say “When this data field is filled out, there is a 25% greater chance that **dependent variable outcome** occurs. Thus, we should fill it out.”

I am looking for career advice. 
I am a final year computer science student. I have been interested in ML and Data Science for past few months. Am decent/good with stats and linear algebra. 
Also complete andrew ng's ML course.
Haven't built any good projects though. 

I am not from a great college. So right out of my bachelor's its incredibly difficult to get any good DS roles that is `if there even are any entry level roles for DS/ML/data engineering`
I was wondering what path should I follow to get into MLE. I am interested in software design as well.  So I found data engineering can be good perhaps.
I dont really see myself getting into core research (as of now- who knows about the future?)

I have been doing full stack dev for the past month (its coz of a uni project).
So what I am wondering is will getting some full stack experience help me in any way to get into data related fields or not apart from any personal projects I make. Basically should i do general software engineering and improve my coding skills first
Or should I just stick to ML and jupyter note book based projects. What else should i do **practically** to get into data engineering roles atleast.
What I have been seeing is not many people are working or ML models from scratch but rather building upon existing licensed models like chatgpt.

Any advice?"

I'm currently working on a project that involves optimizing our company's data through a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard needs to be accessible and interactive for all employees.

My plan involves using SharePoint, PowerApps, PowerAutomate, and PowerBI. However, I'm unsure about the subscription requirements for our team. We're a group of around 50 members.

Do you know if one user subscription would grant access to the dashboard for the entire team? Or would each employee need an individual subscription?

does anyone know how can I calculate consistency of values in Excel by also taking into account those values?

For example, there are 3 students and their scores on multiple exams, where score ranges from 0-100.

1st student scores are 99 79 85 100 88
2nd student scores are 55 56 58 52 53
3rd student scores are 20 98 57 34 92 

so obviously first student is the best and most ""consistent in a positive way"", but 2nd student is most consistent (lowest standard deviation) with his scores, but obviously not good as first one. The third one has the highest standard deviation (least consistent) but has higher average score on all tests than 2nd student.

I have tried using stratified crossfold validation as well to prevent model overfitting. I have checked through my code implementation and I don't think that there are any intentional data leakage, aside from the fact that my preprocessing steps were done on the whole dataset and not a splitted dataset beforehand.

Daily 2. Several times a week 3. Once a week 4. Once a month 5. Once every three months 6. At least once a year

I only have these two variables to form the variable ""Regularity"". I thought of assigning a number to each category of my variable ""reading frequency"", for example to ""Daily"" I gave (7), to ""several times a week"" I gave a (5), ..., to ""at least once a year"" I gave (1). Then, I thought of multiplying these values with the values of the variable ""number of books"". For example, if someone reads ""Once a week"" (4) and has read 12 books in the last 12 months, their reading regularity score would be 4 x 12 = 48. If someone else reads ""Daily"" (7) but has only read 5 books in the last 12 months, their score would be 7 x 5 = 35. From this resulting variable, I thought about grouping the scores into Regular/not regular or Very regular/regular/not regular. Any suggestions, please?

I've worked at the IT department in application management focussing on the different healthcare systems and their integration. For example, getting lab results tho the patient record. Over the years, I have tought myself basic python, linux, and SQL

During COVID i did almost all of the data extractions for reporting and eventually switched to the BI department of the hospital, which is NOT part of IT. I am now, what most people would discribe as an SQL monkey. 

A year ago, my only peer at the IT department left. A guy who kinda did what i do, but more robust, as his extractions and programming guide individual patient care, and mine guide policy. I don't care if miss 14 edge cases of high blood pressure in a year report that includes thousands of patient. As he was (is) more experienced than I, he was my mentor. He tought me a lot about ETL's and i know when i have to use those techniques. But when I'm not using our ETL framework, i feel like i have no clue what i'm doing. Of course, my jupyter notebooks are somewhat organised, i don't mix raw and processed data, i don't name my variables a and b.

I have a great boss. she tells me what to do, and i'm free to do whatever i want. But there's not really anyone in my organisation that can tell me (or suggest) how i should probably best do what i have to do. If i simplify it, i can make a .csv data dump and use python, or i can build daily scheduled incremental ETL's and have others build Power BI on top of that. What's in between and when to apply it?

Am I missing some resources? If i google this i find stuff like 'how to organise your code' or 'how to become a better programmer' kinda stuff. I don't think it's data governance, because a lot of what i do is temporarily and data governance looks more something for IT. I could be wrong ofcourse."

"" The goal of this project is to make you learn machine learning by trying to solve a task with it.
First, choose a question that you will have to answer using Machine learning. We expect that your question pertains to a model/algorithm or an application. Then, conceive a study that will try to answer your question. Your study will need an element that is new. For example, it could be a variation of an existing algorithm, or the results of an existing method on a new dataset.""

Do you guys have any idea that could inspire us? We would like to do something using Neural Networks. Our first idea was to use a dataset of reddit's AmITheAssohole posts, and try to predict if the OP is an asshole. But we are currently exploring other ideas because it seems like our idea was pretty much already done multiple times, especially with chatgpt. We couldn't find something 'new'.

The discussion covered a wide spectrum of topics, offering valuable insights into his professional journey, the integration of newer GPT models compared to their older counterparts, and the model that ultimately proved effective for Voiceflow after rigorous experimentation with various latency-sensitive options.

The conversation took a fascinating turn as we explored the intricacies of building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems at Voiceflow. This technology has become increasingly pivotal in the development of conversational AI and enriched our understanding of Voiceflow's innovative approaches.

Additionally, the dialogue delved into the intriguing area of how Voiceflow incorporates the cost of OpenAI into its plans. This aspect highlights the financial strategies and considerations that are essential in maintaining the functionality and affordability of the platform.

Pick any cloud provider you like, they all have free trials, and put together a simple project on there that shows the domain you're interested in without taking examples from others.

1155342510361690182,"> Is DS still a relevant field of study?

This is debated pretty heavily. I think its a relevant study if the goal is to produce data literate people that hopefully embeds CS and stats to any domain. I think the issue is that they focus on ML/AI/ Deployment strategies without having the prerequisite domain knowledge to consider if they need any intensive ML solution vs simple stats like linear regression. 

> Another thing I noticed was every job listing has its own definition of DS lol, one post describes pure DE work, but lists it as a DS position,

Yeah infamously Facebook data science position is mostly SQL monkey stuff. Other than FANG and tech orgs; alot of companies have very weak data practices - so if you were to be a DS, you need to be a DE to engineer the pipelines for your own solutions

>  In summary I wanted to ask whether pursuing a strict DS degree, affect my employment chances with the latest diminishing roles seen for data scientists?

If you are a working professional, I don't think you should think about your chances of employment when you're obtaining a higher degree. You can still get a job with a undergrad like you have just demonstrated.   

The purpose of getting a masters is to elevate and broaden your horizons within data/stats/cs. Thats something you enjoy learning. The aftermath is looking for oppurtunies to use that experience. DS will be packaged around other titles like analytics/engineer/MLE. 

But also if your career goal is not to be too technical - why go for a masters? Unless you enjoy learning. Go for it"
1155334293879521290,"Hey, new here, so pardon me if I am asking a very repetitive question. Is DS still a relevant field of study? I will be starting my Master's study in it soon, and I have carefully picked out a course which includes not only just ML related courses, but an array of software engineering and databases courses as well. I also understand that the degree  program you attend hardly ever translates to an exact copy of the career, which is fine with me. Another thing I noticed was every job listing has its own definition of DS lol, one post describes pure DE work, but lists it as a DS position, etc. In terms of personal interests, honestly, I am quite flexible. I studed EECS during my bachelors (Electrcial Eng and CS), and had a range of CS topics, from pure algorithmic to ML based ones. + been working since Aug 2021, and full time since April 2023, and since it's an AI startup, dipped my toes in everything, so have experience with experimenting, visualizing, pipelining, implementing and deploying entire sw structures, which is a bit hectic but I am glad since it should be a big help I imagine in the future. Not to mention, I never intended to stay in the technical role for too long, I envision myself eventually climbing to some managerial position, with context to data.

BG: I am a final year Bachelor of Technology (Information Technology) student in India. My question is-  
Is it worth getting a diploma from IIT Madras (online diploma in data science) - pretty much just for name sake? **IIT Madras is like a top 3 college in india for tech.**  
The courses they offer - I have know majority of them already. But was looking to get that shiny tag in resume to get shortlisted. Or is doing coursera courses fine as well? Or do the projects matter much more?
The courses they offer are mostly linear algebra, machine learning algos (2 courses), and one business application course. (There are a total of 6 courses and 2 projects spanning 8 months)
The diploma costs like 10x the cost of Machine learning specialization by Andrew Ng on coursera (*I have completed that btw if it helps*).
I have also learnt linear algebra, stats, calculus in uni. (although i get rusty time to time)"

Take a step back - physically from the computer

Observe how you're feeling, without getting caught up in it. ""I feel like I'm not good at this"" without proceeding to ""so I shouldn't be a coder""/""I'll never be good at this"".

Proceed mindfully - how can you be most effective right now at getting better at coding? Is it asking someone else to help explain that concept? Is it re-reading it later?  Taking a walk? I've sometimes written down the problem and solution in a notebook and gone out to get coffee. It's easier to think about the issue when I've got no tech near me.

   - Some census thing about making $50K.

2. **Kaggle**: It's a site. They've got competitions and data.
   - Titanic? People trying to guess who lived.
   - House prices. Yawn.
   - Tweets about disasters. Some are fake.

3. **Government Stuff**: Some governments dump their data online.
   - US has one. UK too. India? Yep.

4. **World Bank**: They've got numbers on... world stuff.

5. **Gapminder**: More global numbers. Income, life, blah blah.

6. **FiveThirtyEight**: They do news and stats. Check their site.

7. **NLP?**:
   - Movie reviews on IMDb. Like thumbs up or down.
   - 20 Newsgroups. It's old but people use it.

8. **Pictures**:
   - CIFAR-10. Tiny pics of stuff.
   - MNIST. Doodles of numbers.

9. **Time Series**:
   - Airplanes and passengers from the 50s.
   - Stocks. Yahoo has them, I guess.

10. **Social Networks**:
   - Stanford's got a collection. It's big.

Tasks or whatever:
- Clean the messy data.
- Look at it, find patterns.
- Make some charts.
- Maybe build a model if you're feeling fancy.

There. Hope that helps or whatever."

1138938233493926099,"Next thing, couldnt think of something running on that phone. You would need a high image resolution and quality.

300x300 is the currently most used resolution in this case, just an assumption

Next interesting thing white balance:
There is no real perfect white balance method. You could use a grey card, that would be the most reliable, but therefore everyone owning the app would need a grey card, which has right from production the same color as the one the camera of the training got calibrated on.

Next thing brightness:
In every spot in the world is a little bit different brightness, sure you wouldnt need to be that specific, but you would need a spot where your skin gots the perfect light

If you are forecasting temperatures in Celsius, 0.35°C of error is pretty good, assuming also that your application doesn't require a lower error. For example if you are running an experiment where temperature variations of 0.1 C° will ruin the lab samples, suddenly an error of 0.35°C is bad.

Is an accuracy of 90% good? If you are predicting whether stock will go up or down tomorrow it's pretty good. If you are predicting if Nicolas Cage's next movie will be over the top, it's terrible because 9 out of 10 of his movies are over the top, so it's no better than a random guess.

I completed self studying calculus 1 and 2. My plan is to do calc 3 w/ probability, and linear algebra w/ statistics after that.

However, MITOCW's probabilistic systems and applied probability has been rather difficult for me. One of my good friends recommended Georgie Tech's proabibility course. 

So my question is are the following two courses enough to get me started with Data Science?

1. Geogria's Probability https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~sman/courses/6739/
also available on edx: https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/gtx-probability-random-variables
2. Statistics for applications: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/

OR https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/pages/resource-index/ is a must? I am currently taking this right now and I am not a huge fan of the psets. Its way too hard and so are the recitations and since there aren't any easy problems the learning curve is way too steep. I am also in a time crunch so its hard for me to go out of my way to research new things.

Georgia's probability also has stats in the course. But its preferable I take statistics for applications as well right?"

```
tensor([[0.2429, 0.9332, 0.5765, 0.6409],

The constraints are usually expressed as pairwise statements indicating that two items must, or cannot, be placed into the same cluster."" so maybe it can help you if you already know the rules.

1129901094638731284,"Hi everyone! I have a question about transformers and their input. Imagine we're using an encoder decoder architecture (like the classic transformer) for a sequence to sequence task (like machine translation). Do both the **target** data and **input** data gets padded to the maximum **input** sequence length in their respective batch? 

I'm asking because as you can see from the formula of attention, when we'll reach the multi-head attention at the decoder level that attends to both input and target, it will consider the output of the masked multi-head attention from the decoder as queries, and the keys and values are the output from the encoder.
So if we pad to different numbers we'll have a matrix multiplication issue there at QK^{T} (because Q will be of shape (batch_size, target max sequence length, d_model) while K will be of shape (batch size, input max sequence length, d_model)"

month, client_id, metric_1,..... metric_2000ish.    ( No, this is not bad schema design, there are that many unique aggregated metrics)

month and client_id are the only two columns it would make sense to have an index on. New columns are added and old ones are taken away every few months or so.

I have a web app which calls an API to generate reports from this data. The data is  randomly accessed, but a million cells might need to be returned. at once from random points in the entire dataset.

E.g. I want to see these [60 metrics for these 1000 client_id's] but 20 different months for each of these combinations.

The issue is that they all seem to assume that the time between each reading is constant, like monthly rainfall. I am interested in a solution which takes a specific time period as a window, and includes all readings within that time period, somehow weighting each reading by the length of time until the next reading.

But I don't believe in it since we're changing the training distribution the classifier was trained upon no? Like maybe the classifier will have a hard time with images with low contrast but I believe it's better to just feed train it on more of this type of data or retrain a whole new classifier with those preprocessing steps already present in the data.
Also, I think that all those preprocessing steps that aim to change the characteristics of an image like playing around saturation, colorfulness, brightness etc., don't really work if we're using CNNs since the kernels are found in such a way that they can pick up the relevant transformations they'll apply right?"

Your architecture is going to address system level concerns in a software project. Your design patterns are about how you organize and implement the code. 
 
For architecture, what is the entire system trying to achieve? What are the overall constraints and requirements? To meet the requirements and constraints, what is the technology stack we're going to use, why, how will the problem of meeting these constraints be cut up into subsystems, etc. So if we're building a website that recommends books, deciding we are going to build a recommender system, what services to use for ingesting and processing data, how inferences will feed into a website, what APIs will we create if any, monolith/microservices, and what tech we're using for the website, what will be used for authorization, what databases, etc etc; that's all architecture.

When we get down to writing code at the subsystem level, we're getting into design patterns. If you're writing the code that displays a recommendation on the page, how should that code be organized? What types of classes and methods should be used, and how should they interact? If we have lots of similar objects in code that need to be instantiated a little differently, what's the best way to structure that? Some of your design patterns may also be dictated by the tech stack you chose at the architecture level. Lots of opinionated frameworks will have specific design patterns you should use (e.g. Redux in React has some clear patterns for data access in your web site's components)."

The problem comes when I get 600 more rows with the same data from the first data set and now all the models that I test with this extended data set fall in over fit and I do not know what to do since I preprocessed all the data and they are practically the same as the data from the beginning.

1110274753752748054,"I don't think it's an invalid fear. We're all wondering how powerful new tools are going to change what we do and on what timescales. A couple of thoughts for what they're worth:

- Be someone people *want* to work with. Few things are as good at opening doors and giving you a bit of security as being valuable, effective AND liked. 

- Don't panic. Enterprise adoption cycles are slow because people are change resistant and risk averse. Think how long adopting the PC, analytics, automated fast food kitchens, and self-driving has taken. 

- Accept changes are happening, get comfortable with ongoing change. Realize the market was never static. Avoid denial or 'computers could never do x' arrogance, stay informed, try new things. People have navigated major changes in the past. You will, too.

- Avoid rote learning. **Lots ** of professionals get away with it. They suck, but they're 'good enough'. They're first to go. If we're going to get marginally adequate work anyway, we might as well get it cheap and fast. Be interested in your field, keep growing.

- Understand your domain well enough to teach and supervise others working in it. Think of the skills needed to succeed as professional if every professional had the automated equivalent of a free group of knowledgeable but inexperienced interns.

-Know what your work *means* in a context, not just how to do it. Super stats knowledge is great! Super stats knowledge and knowing how to use it to create value for your clients/team/employer? Gold."

I am trying to use Segment-Anything model by Meta so as to refine cell segmentation masks produced by another model (my end goal is to improve the precision value), I have tried using soft voting ensemble (don't know how correctly I was able to implement it). Please can someone guide me? 


I tried using stacked ensemble method but it is giving issues https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/121662/convolution-neural-network-loss-increasing-instead-of-decreasing Please could someone look into this too? 


My approach- I am running both SAM and the other model(CP) on the training dataset and calculating average precision values for each image. Say for image x I get 0.7 AP from SAM and 0.5 from CP so I will assign it a label of 1(denoting SAM performs better on the image with respect to CP)

Finally I am getting a labels array for the entire training dataset, on which I am training a third network (basically it tries to relate that for a given image whether its better to use CP or SAM so as to get best results)

Now for testing, I am passing the image through the newly trained model which will either pass it to SAM or CP  so as to obtain the best mask (as per its prediction).  But the loss (as stated in the stackexchange thread) is increasing instead of decreasing"

1096655335860752464,Hi folks anyone know where I can find calculus problems of several variables but with solution?
1096356298410426478,"I have the same chart for multiple sources of data and I need to do comparisons. I was thinking some drop-down that would just change the image of that chart. And have that for a side by side. Basically I want to know if there are better tools out there besides PowerPoints / PDF. The issue is the resulting file needs to be sent to team members, and only a few of them are technical. So it needs to be an easy one click situation, one file, and require only things that is standard in windows 10, etc. Is that possible at all? I like other resources, but they either don’t fulfill those or isn’t 100% offline. Any suggestions?"
1096308461047906305,and how can you be sure of the quality of your inference?
1096308396019429396,"I'm willing to argue that the vast majority of business uses cases we will ever see won't revolve around data from randomized controlled experiments, so then that begs the question what can you infer from observational data?"
1096307247669317772,"I can speak for the medical domain but you can probably extend this to business.

Let’s say we want to know how the placement of a stent will impact patient outcomes. The first question is, what kind of data do we need? (What do we define as the “outcome”, what are relevant variables and confounders, how many subjects do we need, what kind of distribution of subjects do we need, etc.)

So you get the data you plug it into a model and get some results. If you are interested in explaining what happened, you might use linear regression and then analyize the data (using statistics) to determine what variables are important and how they impact the outcome.

If you want prediction, you might train a neural network and then see if your predictions are any good, under what conditions, and what is the goodness of fit etc. Again, using statistical measurements and tests."

My dataset contains 590k customers and most of the cleaning is done. My team and I decided that customers that are inactive since 18 months have churned. Therefore I will create a binary variable, called 'Exit', and its values will be 1 if the last transaction is more than 18 months ago, 0 if not. As I understand, this will be my target variable (what I will try to predict). 

I'm trying to understand, after training my model (probably a Decision Tree Classifier), how do I apply my model to my dataset and predict which customers are more at risk of exiting (In other words, the probability of Exit=1 is high) ? Because, I can't predict customers that have already churned. I'll have to predict only the customers where Exit=0?"

What would be the best resources you have come across which provides necessary details on how to perform A/B testing (and its variants A/B/C/D testing) in a production?
    For example how would you know if the effect size of your control/ treatment groups are large enough measure a change that actually means something?

At a really high level perhaps would be something like ""Split cohort into control and treatment of size X, sending one group comms and then other without  and then wait some time period T and measure churn rate between both groups to see difference""

1065003665611567196,"Hello I’m looking for advice. Today I was offered a Data Scientist 1 position within a start up. Mind you i’m interviewing for another role which should lead to a future building models, but to start it’s only a lab technician. The only issue I have with the position is I don’t have professional experience, I have curricular experience from a few comp sci courses i took including databases, data structures and algorithms, data mining, and i also took a machine learning and neural networks course, aside from that I achieved the IBM professional data science certificate through coursera. I’m worried because I would be the only data scientist in this start up, and would essentially learn by myself and as i go. I was very upfront about this during the interview, but they seemed more interested in my soft skills and potential. They said I could start part time to start and the pay would be equity based until they get funding then i would be full time. Another potential red flag is i applied as a machine learning engineer within the company, as the requirements were mostly interest based, and the job i was offered was data scientist 1. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Or sees concerns with this? I don’t want to bite off more then i can chew and put myself or this business in a bad spot"

`The Brainhead.csv dataset provides information on 237 individuals who were subject to postmortem examination at the Middlesex Hospital in London around the turn of the 20th century. Study authors used cadavers to see if a relationship between brain weight and other more easily measured physiological characteristics such as age, sex, and head size could be determined. The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a person’s brain size while they were still alive (as the living are not keen on having their brains taken out and weighed). We wish to determine if there is a relationship between age and brain weight in healthy human adults.`

the question is `Describe the hypothesis test you would use to test for a statistically significant difference in brain weight by age`, here i have chosen a T test. 

then i need to write the assumptions and one of the assumptions for a T test is that the sample data is randomly chosen from a population, but it doesnt say in this description? so what do you do in this case?"

Typically an MLP is present in its most basic form as three layers, input, hidden, output.

Are their ways in which NLP models could provide actionable steps to provide business value within the Marketing domain? If so what are some specific tasks that they could be used to tackle?

> __Example:__ Providing obvious steps that could be performed off of model outputs rather than say getting churn propensity (probability) scores as model outputs and then having to have humans define business logic on how they want to use those values in order to perform some action.

More specifically could NLP models be used in conjunction with customer data provide insight on the best way to phrase advertising/ messages in order to retain/ upgrade customers products? 
My current line of thinking is with this knowledge then maybe specific words could be tweaked and it could aid language used in the advertising sent to increase retention/ perhaps.

**Context**

- I have access to customer data which provides insights on there usage along with a host of other data and can derive features relating to whether they have upgraded there product subscription/ stayed with the product after a certain period of time.
    - In addition to this I have access to messages that were sent to the customer (**_text based data h_**) at specific points in time in order to persuade them to upgrade there subscription.
- The text based data hasn't been utilised much up until now in models so I had the idea of trying to utilise it in some way **_hence I started thinking NLP since texted base data_**
    - I have briefly looked at NLP in the past but more or less am revisiting now (**_not super up-to speed on modern techniques etc_**)
- Any useful pointers to resources/ things that may be of use would be appreciated. My objective is with business value in mind and thus if NLP has useful techniques which might not directly be related to my initial question or the way I phrased it but still could be used in a valuable way I am all ears."

1055428369266786344,"<@497413951814893578> Dear TSCOSJ,

Asking a clear and concise question is an important step in getting a helpful and accurate answer. Providing full context and a minimal working example can greatly improve the chances of getting a useful response.

When asking a question, it is important to give enough information so that someone reading it has a clear understanding of the problem you are facing. This includes providing details about the context in which the problem is occurring, as well as any relevant information about the software or system you are using.

A minimal working example is a small piece of code or configuration that demonstrates the problem you are facing. It should be as short as possible while still showing the issue you are experiencing. By providing a minimal working example, you make it easier for others to understand and reproduce the problem, which can help them find a solution more quickly.

Here are a few points to consider when asking a question to ensure that you provide enough context and a minimal working example:

Clearly describe the problem you are facing: What are you trying to accomplish? What happened instead?

Provide details about the context in which the problem is occurring: What software or system are you using? What version? What are the relevant settings or configurations?

Include any error messages or other output that you have encountered: These can provide valuable clues about the cause of the problem.

Provide a minimal working example: This should be a small piece of code or configuration that demonstrates the problem you are experiencing. Be sure to include any necessary setup or dependencies.

By following these guidelines, you can help others understand your question and find a solution more quickly and effectively.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"

We're predicting hospital admissions. Given a few years of hospital data, we want to predict the daily admissions for various cohorts. However, some hospitals seem to suddenly change behaviour. For instance, one hospital was discharging 5x the mean number of patients on Fridays when suddenly Friday became like any other day. But (despite playing with the `changepoint_prior_scale` hyperparameter), Prophet keeps thinking Friday is special for this hospital even 6 months after the switch.

Maybe Prophet was the wrong choice. Any thoughts?

If you look at the exercises for the dataset on this page, ignoring that it's in R, you can start to get a good idea of questions to ask about data and how to find the answers. 

""Compare air_time with arr_time - dep_time. What do you expect to see? What do you see? What do you need to do to fix it?""

This is my favourite example of this. It asks you to look at the data, then make clear your assumptions about a relationship in the data, then validate that assumption. 

That's a great way to learn how to interpret data, by finding your implicit assumptions and developing methods to validate them."

Today we launched Out-of-Distribution Detection now natively supported in cleanlab 2.1 to help you automatically find and remove outliers in your datasets so you can train models and perform analytics on reliable data -- it's only one line of code to use.

What makes our out-of-distribution package different?

Many complex OOD detection algorithms exist but they are only applicable to specific data types. The `cleanlab.outlier` package works as effectively as these complex methods, but also works with any type of data for which either a feature embedding or trained classifier is available.

`cleanlab.outlier` is:
- Open-source and free to use
- Research published + few-lines-of-code tutorials
- Benchmarked to show superior performance in the landscape of OOD methods.

Have fun using `cleanlab.outlier`!

I do. Initially, I was planning to store the cache in the notebook itself somehow, but the notebook spec does not really make that easy. So I went for a companion file

I probably should differentiate caches for different services like you say, e.g. cache-openai.json, cache-textcortex.json, etc.

I didn't get this exactly? In the current workflow, the user chooses a service at the beginning and goes along with that. Until now, we haven't encountered a situation that justifies switching to a different one after kernel launch. Did you have something in mind?

To clarify this design choice, we are aiming for a UX where the user writes in plain language, does not really care much about what is going on in the background, and everything should ""just work"". I realize there is still a long way until we reach that point though"

To answer these questions you set up null hypothesis, run statistical tests for example t-test here and identify the ""statistical significance"" to conclude if one variant is better than the other.

You can also get a quick understanding of how variables relate to each other and themselves - is X correlated, even loosely, with Y. Is Z likely forecastable? Humans are really good at telling if a variable has a frequency, a seasonality, a trend."

997107476627476490,"@everyone Hey, I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence. From what I've understood studying AI for 2 years and my own personal research, AI is purely a theoretical study with no practical application unless I merge it with another industrial skill such as cloud computing or data science. For example, a data scientist might use machine learning to create his algorithm/data model. But there is no use in studying AI by itself (like a bachelor's in AI) unless you want to go towards research in AI.

974084203899654164,"Hello **everyone**, 

Something intriguing occurred while I am researching on rare disease event with an hospital. As we are dealing with rare events, it might be obvious, we are dealing with severe class imbalance problem that we are dealing by combining (1) a random undersampling technique and (2) an ADABoost method with a basic random forest as the base learner (i.e, a RUSBoost configuration). *In addition, we ran this configuration using a Deep Forest configuration that employs layers of NN but with a base learning classifier in place of neurons, although that is probably irrelevant here.* Overall, the outcomes were far superior to a baseline model from a medical standpoint, therefore we decided to proceed but still as we are dealing with rare events/class imbalance our results are a little weak but that is OK medically speaking for the time being.

We are now in the phase of plotting a bit of our results, and something truly fascinating has occurred: I believe our model has poor calibration, since he consistently predicts a value slightly above 0.5 for one class and slightly below 0.5 for the other.  Not 0.8 and 0.2 for exemple given a binary class prediction. 

According to the probabilities I received, it does not appear that there is a significant difference between the two classes from the algorithm standpoint. Presumably a calibration issue. May I inquire, what are your thoughts please guys? *(Maybe the RU, or Deep Forest, or ADABoost, the potential issue?)*

In addition, I have included two brief screenshots (One shows the proba that are like that almost for the whole dataset; the second shows the distribution of my two class given their proba, and it appears 0.51 is for one class, and 0.48 for the other mostly). I would have anticipated, for a given record, one proba class with 0.7 and the other with 0.3, or less than close to 0.5 for sure.

Cheers everyone for your help 🥳"
972186611649503292,"Hi people, I'm finding topic to interview data analysts/ data scientists for my blog articles. 

I have some ideas, however, they are still not well-framed, and I haven't decided on which one to proceed. Some of the ideas:
- Exploratory data analysis (I find this process really important to understand dataset and facilitate further analysis or modelling but not much discussion abt it)
- Problem solving skills in a data analytics project (How to break down problem, which issue to solve and which not, how to form hypotheses, etc.)

Can you give me more opinions or your experiences about those ideas? Some helpful questions:
- Do you find it hard when starting out a project? Struggling with the EDA part?
- Do you usually find the problem you need to solve too general and you get confused/ overwhelmed?

Or any issue you wanna further discussion. I wanna know more about other's struggling when doing a data science/ data analytics project. Thanks!"

I'm confused by the paradox of choices that I have to get my hands on. I would appreciate if someone can share what would be the right path.

What I've been able to gather:
1. Learn Flask and deploy a model using that.
2. Go for DP-900 Azure certification and use Azure pipeline services for model deployment

How do I get started? My aim is to develop something as I learn and not just gain theoretical knowledge. Happy to hear any ideas. Thank you!"

947042591579463710,"to data science experts :D, according to Hands-On-Machine Learning book
""It is often the case that a learning algorithm will try to optimize a different function than the performance measure (such as RMSE) used to evaluate the final model. This is generally because that (1) function is easier to compute, because (2) it has useful differentiation properties that the performance measure lacks, or (3) because we want to constrain the model during training, as you will see when we discuss regularization.""

can some tell me if my understanding is correct? the statement (1) easier means that performance measure will require to train the model first in order to obtain the final parameters to apply in the performance measure, (2) i think it meant to apply derivation? , and (3) similar to (1) having optimization function will help along the way to check while training?

You're attempting to do distributed learning over classifiers with functional encryption?

On first read it looks viable, you'd need to write a fair amount of code yourself, but you'd either validate their paper or challenge it. They've given a dataset (MNIST), their model arch, and some pseudocode, so it's mostly model networking, which is like a few weeks of work at worst.

But at the same time there is so much absolute nonsense, conspiracy like and otherwise, that without certain heuristics regarding the typical authors and their worldview you'd be stuck all day neck deep in bullshit. 

I think this dismissive attitude develops sometimes in people who spend too much time thoroughly debunking bad science or other bullshit. It's probably draining and time consuming work and the offenders will publish new bullshit that people will eat up before you're even done debunking the last thing they wrote. If you take on that role of spending your time debunking claims it's no wonder you grow  perhaps overly dismissive after some time. 

It's not an excuse but maybe an explanation and it's something I've been thinking about myself lately. I try to read both sides of not all but some debates but I have limited time on my hands and things to do. At some point I have to make up my mind despite not deeply considering all arguments from all angles. Basically that means making a judgement call on what arguments are or aren't worth considering.

I'm creating a pipeline from AWS quicksight, where I get .csv's from s3 and draw them on quicksight. This needs to be automated since I'm trying to create a monthly dashboard with all the information.

This dashboard needs to be fed from 3 different csv's. Doing that ingestion manually (through quicksight itself) it's easy since you just need to click in the  ""add, reemplace or edit""  button,  and then when you create a new panel then you choose the dataset you want to point and the variables load themselves in the field list.

I'm trying to emulate this through boto3 (python) and the only way I've found is creating a dataset that has my csv's in the 'SourceEntity"" dictionary, where you point a template and the dataset reference (here is where I add the list of csv's I need). But when you do this, quicksight (or the aws sdk) creates a single dataset (which has inside all the datasets i've pointed). This is created with the create_analysis function in the quicksight api from boto3.

872212090235023380,"Sure sounds good but think maybe my context wasn't enough.

Basically they themselves don't have a clear question in mind and so I am planning on helping them identify KPI's and other metrics and will get stuck into there data to find things that hopefully ultimately  help them optimise and improve on these KPI's. During this process I will need a good way of not only documenting my data and the story, say through something like Jupyter notebooks but be able to then share the end results (whether in the end the analysis leads to me creating an dashboard/ graphs through a BI tool such as PowerBI which can then be shared easily for there consumption or creating say a standalone document such as pdf). 

In both scenarios is there a best practice way to upload the separate analysis pieces such that they can have easy intuitive access and consumption of the information?
--> Say I use pdfs which contain the business question analysis etc is there a location where people tend to put this so that it is accessible by business executives etc who want to read it? Product Manager said shouldn't really have executives having to go through github pages etc searching for it so was wondering whether anyone has suggestions or best practices they use or know of?
--> For interactive dashboards/ visuals they want to view in-order to keep track of KPI's etc I feel is fine to be created/shared over BI tools like PowerBI however then for analysis that's done in python not 100% sure whether its worth having those graphs/ data displayed into PowerBI or if this is common practice or frowned upon etc?

Apologies though, think context at this point is still fairly limited so kind of hard to fully describe/ put across situation but this is sort of along the lines of my current thought process."

Say you perform some work (data cleaning, visualising, analysis) using python, whats the best way to display that and get that across to business users such that they can view the results in an intuitive manner? I had a conversation with a product manager and he said things like jupyter notebooks are great (for other data scientist/ analysts or techie people) however some executives don't really need to see the code only say:

1. Sent across reports/dashboards (analysis) via email 
2. Perhaps even through a BI tool such as PowerBI

then I binded the variable I wanted to predict using (airpollPC <- cbind(pca, train_poll$MORT) and made it as dataframe again.

then applied lm function to the new data (lim.poll2 =lm(MORT~., data=airpollPC)

then I treid the predict function again, but the preg.coef is not even a function so an error showed up. : ""

If you make a model that's 99.9% accurate for the next 50 years, is that a good model?

If the benchmark for a simple model is 99.99%, it's not.
If the benchmark is 99%, but it's only used for broad generalisations, then the extra .9% isn't helpful. 
If the benchmark is 99.9%, but it's easier to use than your model, then your model still isn't good."

837248465565646858,"Thanks for your comprehensive answer <@!270413878393831426>, I'm thinking about regression model. The main problem for me is a understanding a result , do a good predict, or thinking that is possible.  Why?  Maybe I give you a bad example. I don't have a empties values , but the sales is irregular. I have 2 years History and i know that 20 Months my Sales equal 0 and other Months a Sales equal 2000 pieces. I can't find a way which indicate me how to compute future forecast for this position, telling me that i sell in the future 500 pieces.  It is possible?"
837244496957800458,"<@!787942148179886090>  It appears you are asking a few questions here, so let me address the questions I think you are asking.

1. What can I do with missing data? This is a pretty straight forward question and you only have a few real options: remove, replace with 0's or replace with another metric. Removing is recommended if you don't know much about the row or the column, it's also recommended if you have large amounts of data. The downside with removing observations is losing valuable data when you were only missing one or a few values. Replacing with 0's allows you to still calculate metrics (mean, median, mode, etc.) but the missing data won't add any value. Lastly replacing with a calculated value. Think about if you had data about the ages of students in a university class: [22, 23, 24, 25, 22, 24, NA] if you know the NA is also a student in this college class it would not be a crazy assumption to replace the NA with the mean/median/ mode age. I hope that makes sense.

2. How do I predict sales figures? The most basic method for predicting anything is 2 numerical variable linear regression. You can receive very powerful insights from calculating a simple regression model, which you can do on Excel or by hand. If you have already created a linear / logistic regression model and would like to move towards something more sophisticated research some decision tree based modeling. Look at simple forest, or random forest which can give power insights, but are a bit more intensive as far as understanding and implementing. 

Models are only as useful as they can be explained, if you don't understand how your model is using and giving results, it will be difficult to have faith in the accuracy of the final results. I hope that answers your questions."

why can't we just get the model to recognize the shape of parts of the body? but you cut the picture and leave only what's important. then you give only that one or maybe 10 at most to the algorithm. from the __shape__ of the head, eyes, ears (it would need to make up functions to match the shapes), it would see it's a dog, and no infinite pictures would be needed. is this possible?"

Why this happen? When having Neural Networks one of the doubts is how to initialize the weights before starting the training. In NLP.js the same training data generates exactly the same answers because the initialization of the weights is always to put all the weights to 0, so there is no “random” data in the initialization neither during the training. But one of the techniques to initialize the weights is to use random noise, and that means that two different trainings will not start with exactly the same numeric situation.

I have somehow managed to land a Data Engineer role. I have never been a Data Engineer before.
My background is DevOps (Linux for the last 15 years ,and also AWS, Ansible, systems, bash, python, networking, etc). 

At the interview they mentioned being in a Data Team and technologies and terms such as ETL, data pipelines, python, pytest, Jupiter Notebooks (with Pandas, numpy, matplotlib), AWS s3, data wrangling, Linux, SQL, Agile and doing code reviews in Github. I think I have either worked with some of these technologies and/or have played with some of them before but I don't know anything about ETL, data pipelines, pytest, Jupiter Notebooks (with Pandas, numpy, matplotlib),  and doing code reviews to any great extent.  Could someone point me to some recommend learning guides such as MOOCS, online courses etc about those (ETL, data pipelines, pytest, Jupiter Notebooks and doing code reviews)?

Also, what is it like to work in a Data Team, is it different to working in a Software Development Team? How best can I transition from a DevOps (mostly Linux sysadmin type experience) to a Data Engineer mindset? What would be some good things to figure out and ask questions about when you first start in a Data Team?

To gather data it would be best to have data from a big online glasses-vendor with ""live-tryout""-functionality. That way you might can collect images from people trying out glasses and you might also have the final decision of them which they bought. Your target could then simply be has he bought it or not. Or maybe how much time did the customer spend on looking at that glasses before actually buying. Ugly glasses might just be looked at for a few seconds while the good ones are opened in a different tab to cross reference with other models.

Goal:
Given a list of a few hundred 2D coordinate predictions, I want to find the most likely coordinate to contain the label. I also have a coarse prediction of how likely each 8x8 pixel area of the image contains the landmark. The resolution of the image is 512x512.

Method:
 (Using Python) I represent every prediction as a small Gaussian blob on a single 2D image, that add cumulatively. The mean of the Gaussian blob is the predicted coordinate with a std of 1.
If two points are close to one another I want their Gaussian values to cumulatively add so that area has a higher activation. I want to pick the pixel with the highest activation as the final prediction. Attached is a pic of what i mean.

Problem:
Currently, I am generating a Gaussian for each point and adding it onto the mapping, but this is really slow. Is there a mathematically equivalent way to do this that is much faster? e.g. map just the pixel of each prediction onto an image and then apply some function (smoothing?) to it?
Or is there something more clever I can do to achieve the same goal of selecting the most likely final prediction given the list of predictions? Since the pixel values are cumulative, the value of the peak pixel contains some information about how ""confident"" the final prediction might be, so I wish to preserve something like this. I also want to use the coarse likelihood information.

Thanks in advance."

I am not a data scientist in any way or form, but require a specific tool for one single case of this field, but researching the tool i imagine has been difficult as I do not know any of the linguistics in this field.

The problem at hand is the following: I need to find correlations between data points within two connected sets of data.

I have performed physical tests with a few people and then had them fill out a questionnaire as part of an experiment. Now, let's say I note down 5 values for the physical part and 5 values derived from the questionnaire per person. 
Is there any tool that lets me enter the gathered sets of data and easily review potential correlations between values from both 5-value parts? E.g. if I only wanted to know connections that correlate by a minimum absolute correlation of 0.7?

Thank you very much in advance. I know it is rather rude from me to join the server and immediately ask something like this, but I am in an extremely stressful position at the moment and don't see myself finding what I'm looking for in a reasonable amount of time. I hope this is okay.

Here is a single example from the raw data from the .txt dataset file:

`5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2, Iris-setosa`

Giving this to the PyTorch's DataLoader class, it gets converted to this:

`[[5.1000, 3.5000, 1.4000, 0.2000], [0]]`

My questions:
1. Is the `DataLoader` class handling the transformation from categorical labels to a single digit? I don't see anything about that in the docs? 
2. My network does train and loss gradually decreases. It works (comes from a tutorial). But aren't Neural Nets designed to work only when input values are scaled between 0 and 1, since there are ReLU activations which work better with scaled values between 0 and 1?

so a feature - - be it marketplace or anything else - - is successful to the extent that it makes the company (Facebook) money

so from there you ask: okay, how is Facebook making money?

Let’s suppose the answer to this question is idk, ads

from there u can ask, okay, what makes advertisers want to advertise on Facebook?

perhaps the answer to this question is advertisers will advertise when a lot of people will see their ads and/or people will see their ads many times 

okay, so market place is a successful feature to the extent that it makes people log onto Facebook and makes them stay on it for longer 

from there u want to determine: well, does marketplace actually make more people log on and does it actually make people stay on for longer?

so the metrics you might want to look at to answer that question could be the number of people who are logging on and heading straight for the marketplace and how much time users are actually spending on market place pages and see how these metrics are varying over time

- -

what I realized while trying to answer this was advertisers probably also care about the number of people actually clicking on their ads, not just how many people see them and how many times people see them

so an additional metric to look at would be the CTR for ads on marketplace pages

- -

maybe not strictly necessary, but it might also be insightful to look at all these metrics for the marketplace and compare marketplace’s performance on them to the performance of other features

I say it’s not strictly necessary because marketplace can be doing a worse job at adding traffic, relative to the other features, but still upping the net traffic to the site

but the comparison might be insightful in the sense that if hypothetically marketplace is way worse at generating traffic, then it might make more sense to allocate resources to other features or even new features that are hopefully closer to average levels of traffic generation"

```
One planning 4D fan-beam CT (4DFBCT) and 7 weekly 4DCBCT scans were acquired for 10 locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated by a physician in all 4D images. End-of-inspiration phase planning 4DFBCT was registered to the corresponding phase in weekly 4DCBCT images for day-to-day registrations. For phase-to-phase registration, the end-of-inspiration phase from each 4D image was registered to the end-of-expiration phase. Two DIR algorithms—small deformation inverse consistent linear elastic (SICLE) and Insight Toolkit diffeomorphic demons (DEMONS)—were evaluated. Physician-delineated contours were compared to the warped contours by using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average symmetric distance (ASD), false positive and false negative indices. The DIR results are compared to rigid registration of tumor.

720674320891904071,"Hey @everyone ! 

I'm doing a project for a time series analysis class. I have to fit a GARCH type model on the daily closing prices for the Nasdaq index.

I'm doing the assignment using python and my steps where the following:

* Import libraries
* Import time series data
* Feature Engineerings: Create a Daily Log Returns
* Plot the residuals
* Explore the stylised facts (mean: 0 skewness: -0.5, kurtosis: 3.07 )
* Performed Jarque-Bera test (turns out t student distr. despite K ~3)
* Plot ACF/PACF for Daily Log Returns (points at ARCH and GARCH models with p = [4, 5] and q = [0, 1])
* Fit the models

I am currently in this step and am getting a convergence error. Can anybody help be?

```python
# Order
# p = 4
# q = 0

# Creating model 1
model_1 = arch_model(normalized, vol = 'ARCH', mean = 'Zero', p = p, q = q, dist = 'studentsT')

# # Fitting model 1
model_1_fit = model_1.fit()

# # Evaluating model 1
# print('AIC:\t{:.0f}'.format(model_1_fit.aic))
# model_1_forecast = model_1_fit.forecast(horizon = len(test))
# print('RMSE:\t{:.2f}'.format(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(test, model_1_forecast))))

719893741674168361,"does anybody have prior experience / is currently working with using PMML? It's apparently an XML-like standard that allows for easy deployment of models written across different programming languages (R, Python, Java etc.) But I've not even heard of this being talked about (ever) before.
My company is considering the switch over to using PMML instead of python eggs, but my first-day experience with it has been pretty terrible. Just trying to convert an existing Sklearn pipeline using custom transformers into a PMML pipeline is painful. From what I've read so far, it seems I would need to rewrite the custom transformers in Java and inject them into the PMML conversion process using jar files..
Not to mention the inflexibility in the models & transformers that they support..

I guess, if anybody has worked with this format before (and particularly with python sklearn -> PMML), I would like to hear any thoughts from you guys regarding the use-case and benefits over using pure Python for deployment.
I'm currently leaning towards sticking to our old method of deployment (since all the infrastructure and code is already written), but I would like to stay open-minded (deviating from the tools that I'm alr comfortable with using is always difficult!) If it's an industry standard then I suppose I should take the time and effort to learn it..

regularization is meant to prevent overfitting, but hypothetically one could be in a situation where the unseen data follows nearly the exact same trend as the training data, in which cause you’d want an unbiased fit to the training data because that’s what would perform best on the unseen data

does that make sense?

the “strength” of a hand is a discrete variable with values ranging from -2 to 20.

when I try to predict which individual category a hand falls in, the accuracy is low

just from having played the game, I can tell it’s probably because player don’t play hands similar in strength very differently

when I grouped the hand strengths into bins (e.g a bin for hand strength in between 5 and 8) and predicted which bin a hand would fall in, accuracy was much better

<@!683385055954993163> 

Sounds like you want to solve three problems: 

Problem 1: How do you automate ""ingestion""?
  - i.e when you get an invoice from a vendor, how do you make sure it gets stored in data lake / w.e store? 
     - This will have to be some ""storing"" module, that handles probably two things
       - if your vendor has webhooks, it can receive data from them, or maybe if they send email, your service will automatically handle it, and normalize + store the data

Problem 2: When do you run what? 
   - You'll want a service that runs at some interval, creating invoices as needed, and making sure there are no dups sent etc
      - This will be some sort of ""sending"" module. It will periodically query the data store, and generate the invoices needed. it will have to have some kind of ""done"" table, to make sure you don't double send"

697996475048656916,"Hey guys, quick question (hopefully), here's the context:
I have a dataset of 20 different features approx (some ordinal, some binary, some nominal, etc.), 4 of those features are binary columns that indicate whether a user has used a specific function of my app.  I'd like to make a predictive model where I can enter a new user and get as a result what function that user is likely to use.

The reason I'm beating my head here is because I want to start out simple.
The way I see it is, using specific functions of the app aren't exclusive scenarios.  Meaning, just because a user used function 1 doesn't mean he doesn't use function 2.  I would need a predictor that tells me what probability of using each function he has independently.  So in a way, I'm obtaining 4 probability values for each user, each probability value corresponding to a specific function of the app.

So my questions:
1) What algo do I go to for the type of prediction I'm looking for?

2) I can't really get my head around how, if I choose only 4 variables, K-means would show me how the universe distributes around the 4 specific functions I'm asking for instead of any of the other variables.

3) Anyone think of a way I can simplify the model some more?

696085809874337874,you’re gunna lol
696085795349594174,bro you know the dumbest thing I fucking read
696085768896249927,had to google how to spell it still lol
696085730849456248,"because most of these articles aren't giving context to the numbers, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who has no idea about epidemiology"
696085534900093038,which is why imo the constant reporting of deaths is bordering on misinformation
696085415538720928,yes exactly
696085396559364116,would have to go country by country to even get a semi-reasonable estimate
696085390700052541,😓
696085373616652409,"then one starts considering geographic breakdowns, demographics, and then socio-economic factors of particular geographic regions etc etc"
696085345334460416,global would be super super crude
696085245354704916,"i mean, how to even interpret the global value? It seems like it's too crude to be of use"
696085165453082666,very
696085141931556894,this is one of those stats that gets very squirly though
696085029259968662,"haha good catch, yeah"
696084826473627689,if you want rate of survival you might want to have survival in the numerator...
696084519698300930,"off the top of my head...

I think Canada *just* reached its ICU capacity, so one could, in that case, delineate between the two causes of death

But looking at italy statistics, for example, it would be harder to delineate"
696083968910426153,"but, even then, it’s not a perfect estimate because deaths are a function of both the virus’ intrinsic ability to be fatal *and* people dying from not being able to get proper care  when hospitals get over-flooded"
696083577162694696,which is what you want to look at
696083545596231771,because deaths + recovered is cases *with an outcome*
696083473701535795,"that is the best you can go with, yes"
696047913964404817,"Hey so quick question. When looking at the data for COVID19, to get an “accurate” survival rate, you should do deaths / recovered+deaths right? Or is there a better way? There’s an image going around that seem to be portraying 98.4% as the survivability rate and I don’t know where they’re getting that from. I know it’s probably false though."
696013529232441345,"it looks like max_change is a recurring decimal float, thats why the comparison in ur second pic fails (it’s not actually equal to 16.53333)"
695987753560572005,
695987687038910497,
695987625517121566,"my code works this way,but if i actually try to replace max_change with its actual value it doesnt work, why is that?"
695987502699249675,"max_change = model_mpg['mpg_change'].max()
max_change
model_mpg[model_mpg['mpg_change'] ==max_change]"
